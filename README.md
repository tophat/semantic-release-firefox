## Overview

This package provides a set of [`semantic-release`][semantic-release] plugins for you to easily publish Firefox add ons automatically. Mozilla requires that even self-distributed packages are signed through the add on store. Given a built package, it will write the correct version number into `manifest.json` and upload the dist folder to the add on store. The package will be validated by Mozilla, and if valid, a signed distribution will be returned and downloaded into the artifacts folder.

## Motivation

We were working on a dev tooling extension internally and wanted to release it through the Chrome web store and Mozilla Add On store. The [`semantic-release-chrome`][semantic-release-chrome] extension worked wonderfully, but we kept struggling to find a [`semantic-release`][semantic-release] plugin for FireFox that worked the way we wanted. After finding that [`web-ext`][web-ext] had a Node api, we just built our own plugins using `web-ext` to accomplish the goal.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev semantic-release-firefox-add-on
```

## Mozilla Add On authentication

You will need to get two parameters from the Add On store: an `API Key`, and a `Secret Key`. For more information on how to get those parameters and how to set the environment variables which are required in order for this plugin to work properly, read [this guide](https://addons-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/api/auth.html#access-credentials).

web-ext takes care of creation of the JWT, the only items needed are the `API Key` and `Secret Key`.

## Usage

This package export the following plugins:

### `verifyConditions`

Verify the following:

- That environment variables are set for Add On store authentication
- That an extensionId was specified in the configuration
- That the source directory is built and that we can locate the manifest.json file within the source directory

For more information on the environment variables, see [Firefox authentication][firefox-authentication])

#### `verifyConditions` parameters

- `extensionId`: **REQUIRED** The extension id of the extension from the Mozilla Add On store. If this is not specified then a new extension will be created each time the release is run. In order to avoid issues arising due to this, the extension must be created in the Add On store first and the extension Id put into the semantic release configuration.

- `targetXpi`: **REQUIRED** The filename of the XPI file to store in the artifacts directory.

- `sourceDir`: The path of the source directory. Defaults to `dist`.

- `manifestPath`: The location of the manifest file within the source directory. Defaults to `manifest.json`.

### `prepare`

Writes the correct version to the `manifest.json`.

This plugin requires some parameters to be set, so be sure to check below and fill them accordingly.

#### `prepare` parameters

- `sourceDir`: The path of the source directory. Defaults to `dist`.

- `manifestPath`: The location of the manifest file within the source directory. Defaults to `manifest.json`.

### `publish`

Creates an unsigned XPI file out of the source directory and uploads it to the Mozilla Add On, using the web-ext sign command. The output from the sign command will be passed through to the console. If the package is validated and signed, it will downloaded the signed XPI file and store it in the artifacts directory under the specified file name.

#### `publish` parameters

- `extensionId`: **REQUIRED** The extension id of the extension from the Mozilla Add On store.

- `targetXpi`: **REQUIRED** The filename of the XPI file to store in the artifacts directory.

- `sourceDir`: The path of the source directory. Defaults to `dist`.

- `channel`: The release channel, options are `unlisted` or `listed`. An unlisted add on is not published to the store and is justed signed. Defaults to `unlisted`.

- `artifactsDir`: The location to store the signed XPI file when it is returned from Mozilla. Defaults to `./artifacts`.
